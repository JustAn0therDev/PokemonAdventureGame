# Pokemon Adventure Game
A Pokemon Adventure Game with a small re-creation of the Pokemon Battle System.

Made with C# and the .NET Core framework, no external libraries (now targeting .NET 5).

This game is a small re-creation of the Pokemon Battle System (the damage calculation was made based on the formula used by the Pokemon GO game), completely playable on your favorite terminal. 

The game is currently being optimized to use the best that C# and the .NET 5 framework can offer (while keeping the code readable), so the project will be updated from time to time. If you want to contribute optimizing or adding new stuff, you can do so by creating a Pull Request; I'll be happy to help.

## How to play the game

To play it, download the project and publish it locally (you should not have any problems with your operating system or the .NET framework itself). **It is strongly recommended that you have the latest version of the .NET 5 SDK installed**. If you do not have .NET 5 installed on your computer, you can target .NET Core 3.1 (for the test project as well if you want to test it) and run it. No new syntax available in .NET 5 is being used so it will keep running as is. If you have played the game and liked it, consider giving it a star.
