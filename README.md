# PokemonAdventureGame
A Pokemon Adventure Game with a small re-creation of the Pokemon Battle System.

Made with C# and the .NET Core framework, no external libraries.

This game is a small re-creation of the Pokemon Battle System (the damage calculation was made based on the formula used by the Pokemon GO game).

It doesn't have a functional ITEMS option yet, but it will be implemented in the future.
If you play it and like it, please consider giving it a star and letting me know if you have any suggestions on features, bug fixes or quality of the code itself.
